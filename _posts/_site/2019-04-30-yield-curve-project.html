<h2 id="understanding-the-yield-curve-an-economic-predictor">Understanding The Yield Curve: An Economic Predictor</h2>
<p>In this demonstration, we’ll aim to understand what the yield curve is, how it can be used as a predictive tool, and gain knowledge on what the current U.S. Treasury yield curve might be telling us about the economy.</p>

<p>We’ll analyze historical data on the daily Treasury yield curve rates. To analyze what the current yield curve might be telling us, we’ll aim to determine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The U.S. Treasury current yield curve shape</li>
  <li>Comparitive historical yield curve shapes</li>
  <li>The spread between short- and long-term securities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-the-yield-curve-and-why-is-it-important">What is the yield curve and why is it important?</h3>

<p>A yield curve is a graphical representation that shows the relationship between the yield (i.e., interest rate, which is the money you would get back if you lent your money to the government) on securities and the maturity (i.e., duration, or the time you loan your money to the government).</p>

<p>Historically, the yield curve has reflected the market’s sense of the economy. The yield curve is important as it can be used to predict future market conditions.</p>

<h3 id="summary-of-results">Summary of Results</h3>

<p>After analyzing the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&amp;year=2019">data</a>, the conclusion reached is that the current U.S. treasury yield curve appears to be telling us that there might be a gradual slowdown in economic growth in 2019. And that it is possible that a recession could happen some time in 2020 to 2021. Please note that this is only indicative of an economic slowdown and upcoming recession. It is not definitive, within the time periods stated.</p>
