REWRITE BELOW:
Colors are our brains’ way of interpreting the wavelength of light: how far the light travels before the wave pattern repeats itself. But the colors we see—called “visible” or “optical” light—are only a small sample of the total electromagnetic spectrum.

Light is made of particles called photons, bundles of the electromagnetic field that carry a specific amount of energy. 
They’re also wave-like: they can interfere with each other to produce patterns of light and darkness. 
If you’re reading this on a computer screen, the backlight is making photons that travel to your eye, where they are absorbed—and destroyed.
