My name is Sunshine Abbott. I’m a scientist. I first majored in geology (BS degree), then geochemistry (MS degree), and lastly sedimentology (PhD). In between my MS and PhD degrees I was fortunate to have gotten a job as a hardware specialist for the Principal Investigator of the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, an instrument aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. I had the privilege of working on a great team with an awesome supervisor. I upgraded and expanded their supercomputer. I really enjoyed thinking about it and building it. It was amazing to learn about the hardware. But I must admit, the software side of things really intrigued me. 

I went on to Imperial College London where I got my PhD in Sedimentology. During my PhD, I gained exposure to some coding (Python). For example, I automated cleaning and extraction of structured data from raw instrument measurements. I automated regeneration of plots from data files. I implemented descriptive geometric statistics of both field data and stochastic simulations data (e.g., skewness, confidence intervals, etc.). I developed an algorithm to stochastically generate models of the subsurface 3D geometries of rock bodies that could match 2D observations. 

I'm currently working on machine learning projects on dimensionality reduction and clustering.
