My name is Sunshine Abbott. I first majored in geology (BS degree), then geochemistry (MS degree), and lastly sedimentology (PhD). In between my MS and PhD degrees I was fortunate to have gotten a job as a hardware specialist for the Principal Investigator of the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, an instrument aboard NASAâ€™s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. I upgraded and expanded their supercomputer. I really enjoyed thinking about it and building it. It was amazing to learn about the hardware. But, the software side of things really intrigued me. 

I went on to Imperial College, London, where I got my PhD in Sedimentology. I used Python for automation, data extraction, and data analysis. I coupled Python with CAD (Rhino) for 3-D modeling.
