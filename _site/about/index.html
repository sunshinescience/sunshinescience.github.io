<p>My name is Sunshine Abbott. I’m a scientist. I first majored in geology (BS degree), then geochemistry (MS degree), and lastly sedimentology (PhD). In between my MS and PhD degrees I was fortunate to have gotten a job as a hardware specialist for the Principal Investigator of the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, an instrument aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. I had the privilege of working on a great team with an awesome supervisor. I upgraded and expanded their supercomputer. I really enjoyed thinking about it and building it. It was amazing to learn about the hardware. But I must admit, the software side of things really intrigued me.</p>

<p>I went on to Imperial College London where I got my PhD in Sedimentology. During my PhD, I gained exposure to some coding (Python). For example, I automated cleaning and extraction of structured data from raw instrument measurements. I automated regeneration of plots from data files. I implemented descriptive geometric statistics of both field data and stochastic simulations data (e.g., skewness, confidence intervals, etc.). I developed an algorithm to stochastically generate models of the subsurface 3D geometries of rock bodies that could match 2D observations.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on machine learning projects on dimensionality reduction and clustering.</p>
